## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/workers/status` - Get all workers' real-time status
- `GET /api/worker/<worker_id>` - Get detailed worker data
- `GET /api/exposure` - Get exposure data for all workers
- `GET /api/events` - Get event history log
- `POST /api/event/log` - Log a new event
- `GET /api/reports/daily` - Generate daily report
- `GET /api/reports/weekly` - Generate weekly health report

## Simulated Data

The dashboard currently uses simulated data for demonstration purposes:
- 6 workers with randomized status
- Realistic vital signs and environmental data
- Dynamic risk scenarios (70% safe, 20% warning, 10% danger)
- Exposure tracking and risk scoring

## Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Replace simulated data with real wearable device API integration
2. Implement actual Twilio/SMS alert system
3. Add database persistence (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
4. Implement user authentication
5. Add SSL/HTTPS
6. Configure proper logging and monitoring
7. Set up backup and disaster recovery
